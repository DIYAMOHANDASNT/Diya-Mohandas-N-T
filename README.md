I have used Python  to solve all the problems.

Files:

Problem-1.py – A calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
Problem-2.py – Prints a series of odd numbers based on the input.
Problem-3.py – Prints a conditional series of odd numbers depending on the input.

How to run these programs:
If You Are Using an IDE (like VS Code, PyCharm, or IDLE):
Open your Python file in the IDE.
Look for a “Run” button or right-click the file and select Run.
The IDE will open a console and run your code there.
